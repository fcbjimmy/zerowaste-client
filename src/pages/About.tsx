            SBHK stands for Sustainable Hong Kong. Why sustainability?
            Sustainability doesn't just refer to protecting the future of our
            planet against climate change. It is an all-encompassing concept
            concerned with ensuring the continuity of quality, access and
            opportunity in all areas of life for future generations.

            Looking to take a step towards zero-waste living? It can be as
            simple as refusing plastic bags, carrying a reusable bottle with
            you, and making the effort to shop at places that limit the amount
            of plastic packaging you take home. With a number of zero waste
            stores now dotted around the city housing refill stations for pantry
            staples, washing up liquids, plastic-free beauty products and more,
            it's easier than ever to be an eco-conscious shopper in Hong Kong.

                My name is Jimmy and I am an aspiring front-end developer. As I
                graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Environmetal and
                Sustainable Development, I wanted to make a project related to
                my studies. So, I believe promoting local Environmental
                Sustainable shops will be a good start and a good way to promote
                moving to a plastic-free lifestyle, as a result, everyone can do
                their bit to help protect the environment.
